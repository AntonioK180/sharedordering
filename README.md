# Shared Ordering Website
An official repository for my diploma work - sharedordering.com

The "Shared Ordering Website", as the name suggests, is a platform, which connects users in a local area (e.g. city, town, state) and lets them order something from abroad together! The platform's goal is to save money and delivery time for the end customer of online stores.
